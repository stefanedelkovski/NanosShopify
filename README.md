### Note: node_modules is not imported

The problem occurs in the index_import.js file, when I try to use the useQuery function from @apollo/client. For now I'm just trying to retrieve a simple query with the shop name, test if that works. Based on what I've researched on the internet, the problem is located somewhere in the imports, but I didn't manage to resolve it.
